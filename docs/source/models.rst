models package
==============

The :code:`models` package contains objects and functions for working with different models of the subsurface.

Horizontally Layered Models
---------------------------

The simplest possible model is a horizontally layered model. An object representing horizontally layered models is
called :code:`HorizontallyLayeredModel`.

Here are some things that this object can do:

+ Calculate theoretical dispersion curves for Love and Rayleigh waves
+ Export itself to a SEG-Y format to be loaded in Tesseral
